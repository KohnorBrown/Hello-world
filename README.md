# Hello-world
Basic hello world

Well I wanted to get more into coding but I'm not too sure if this is the right place to do it.
So if someone happens to come accross this I'd really appreciate if you can point me in the right direction.
I have books about C++ as well as basic Java coding. hmmm.... maybe I should just read the books or make some coffee
and attempt to hone my writing skills. I do like reddit because I can find a community for almost about anything. 
Ultimately, I need to find a hobby to pre-occupy my time. Yet, without some feedback on lets say a short story, then how would
I be able to write a novel. Even if it is a shite novel, I'd still be writing something, something I can put my name on and throw
out to the world. I guess that's ultimately what I would like about coding too. Throwing something out there that I can put my name
on. Except, programming just seems like it'd have more value. Shit why don't I do both? Wouldn't that be great. 
Alright well first I need to think of a pen name. A pen name that I can do my creative writing on. I've always enjoyed writing.
Funny enough though, I have a hard time reading. But I am curious, what would be the best way to go about starting to write? 
That's why all these people are doing blogs right? That's I guess why people go to the internet as well. It allows them to connect
with individuals that can relate to eachother. Now being the introverts that alot of us have become due to the rise of the internet;
I figure there are some issues that alot of people can relate to but have yet to have come up in their lives. 

Let's scour the corners of reddit and figure out what I can write about, how to go about it, any other thing I can do such as
coding/writing that I would be able to put my name on and throw out to the world.
